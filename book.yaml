  excerpt: "To many Web developers, being good at CSS means you can take a visual mock-up and replicate it perfectly in code. You don't use tables, and you pride yourself on using as few images as possible. If you're really good, you use the latest and greatest techniques like media queries, transitions and transforms. While all this is certainly true of good CSS developers, there's an entirely separate side to CSS that rarely gets mentioned when assessing one's skill."

  excerpt: "JavaScript's closures provide an excellent way to make variables and functions private, keeping them out of the global scope. This is particularly important in the browser because all scripts share the same scope, and it's quite easy to inadvertently pick a variable or function name used by another library."

  excerpt: "Way back in September of 2013, while testing my Solved by Flexbox project, I discovered a bug in Internet Explorer 10 and 11 that was preventing my sticky footer from actually sticking to the bottom of the page. I spent some time trying to work around the issue, but all my attempts failed."

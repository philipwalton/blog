Recently, [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/), an online web design and development blog, published an article I wrote for them entitled: [Defending Presentational Class Names](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/22/defending-presentational-class-names/).

In the article I discuss the use of presentational classes, why we've historically avoided them, and how perhaps some situations might warrant their use today. I hope you find it helpful, and as always, I welcome your feedback.

Here's an excerpt as well as a [permalink](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/01/22/defending-presentational-class-names/) to the full article:

> The problem comes when generally good advice like prefer semantic class names gets turned into never use presentational class names under any circumstance. Best practices for writing front-end code shouldnâ€™t be dogmatic. They should be based on whether or not the advice actually helps the development process. As web technology changes, what was once sound advice will not necessarily always be so. We have to continually examine our best practices and only use them if they make our lives easier.
